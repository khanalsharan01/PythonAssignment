    If one tadata type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’ again. Then yes it will change the value. While creating a variable any 
    datatype is not decleared in python, python determines and assigns a data type to the variable.  Variables are like an empty box that can contain values of any data type, when you reassign 
    it it will empty the old value and then new value will be placed inside of it.
